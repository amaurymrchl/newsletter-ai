<p>TradingView's analysis, dated November 21, 2025, compares two major players in the semiconductor industry—NVIDIA (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
(TSM).
The article highlights key factors influencing their performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong> is positioned as a leading fabless semiconductor company, focusing on graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and data center solutions.
Its success hinges heavily on the demand for artificial intelligence applications and the growth of gaming and professional visualization markets.</li>
<li><strong>TSM</strong>, on the other hand, is a major contract chipmaker, responsible for manufacturing chips for companies like NVIDIA.
The company's future rests upon maintaining its competitive edge in advanced node processes (7nm or below) and increasing its share in foundry services for tech giants and startups alike.</li>
</ul>
<p>TradingView examines these factors against the backdrop of broader industry trends:
- <strong>AI Fund Raising</strong>: The growing importance of artificial intelligence is fueling both companies' growth, driving increased capital expenditure (CapEx) in R&amp;D and manufacturing capacity expansion.
- <strong>Data Center Demand</strong>: This sector’s boom due to cloud computing expands the potential for TSM as a foundry partner but also poses risks if other players like Samsung or Intel gain significant market share.
- <strong>Geopolitical Risks</strong>: Supply chain disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties affect both companies differently, with TSM potentially feeling more pressure due to its Taiwanese base.</p>

                        <p>Fundraising trends across key sectors in Europe and globally reveal a surge in investment for cutting-edge technologies that harness Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Notable highlights include:</p>
<p>1.
<strong>Flexion Robotics' $40 million Series A funding aims to develop AI systems enabling humanoid robots to transition seamlessly from simulated environments to real-world tasks, underscoring the convergence of AI with physical robotics for practical applications across manufacturing, healthcare, and disaster response.</p>
<p>2.
An undisclosed fintech startup secured $75 million in funding, nearly doubling its valuation to near $300 million, targeting repetitive tasks like data entry and report generation within banking through advanced NLP and machine learning technologies—marking a pivotal trend in financial process automation.</p>
<p>3.
Neuralink, led by Elon Musk, is expected to raise approximately $15 billion this December, reflecting global enthusiasm for neurotechnology, particularly brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), with ambitions extending from medical therapies to cognitive enhancement and workforce augmentation.</p>
<p>4.
EdgeCortix, an edge AI solutions provider, successfully closed a Series B round exceeding $110 million, signaling the burgeoning demand for technologies that process data closer to its source—at network edges—to improve efficiency in applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and IoT devices.</p>
<p>5.
Function, an AI health startup, amassed $298 million from a round led by Tiger Global Management, utilizing the funds to enhance its diagnostic platform focusing on early disease detection via medical image analysis.
This investment exemplifies growing confidence in AI's transformative role within healthcare diagnostics, potentially disrupting traditional systems with more accurate and timely diagnoses for conditions like Alzheimer's and cancer.</p>
<p>These fundraising events underscore three critical trends</strong>: a strengthened global commitment to advanced technologies, accelerating investment in sectors primed for AI-driven transformation (robotics, finance, neurotech), and the increasing reliance on edge computing solutions for real-time data processing.
Such developments position key players as leaders in their respective fields, poised to reshape industries through rapid innovation powered by deep learning and other sophisticated AI capabilities.</p>
