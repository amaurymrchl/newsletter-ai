                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>
The article from Hugging Face, published on November 24, 2025, introduces a novel taxonomy and evaluation framework for saliency maps in AI systems.
This work aims to bridge the gap between human understanding of model outputs and current AI explanatory tools by proposing a cognitive alignment approach.
The authors argue that existing methods often fail to capture essential aspects of how humans perceive and interpret AI-generated results.</p>
<p>The new framework, named "Rethinking Saliency Maps," is designed to align more closely with human visual attention patterns, potentially improving trust and interpretability in AI systems.
Key features include:</p>
<p>1.
A taxonomy that classifies saliency map types based on their alignment with human visual attention.</p>
<p>2.
An evaluation protocol to assess the effectiveness of these maps for various applications like object detection or image captioning.</p>
<p>3.
Integration with existing toolkits and models, enabling straightforward implementation in AI development workflows.</p>
