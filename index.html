                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Titled "What should governments know about AI agents and agentic AI?" by the Global Government Forum, this article explores the growing significance of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems in policy and decision-making processes.
It delves into the potential capabilities of AI agents, which can make decisions independently, adapt to new situations, and even exhibit "agency" – a level of self-directed action previously exclusive to humans.
The piece highlights that these AI agents can process vast amounts of data and offer insights within seconds, far outpacing human capacity.
However, it also warns about the risks: biases in training data leading to unfair outcomes, loss of transparency due to "black box" algorithms, and the lack of clear accountability when decisions go awry.
The author emphasizes that governments must address these concerns by establishing ethical frameworks, promoting explainable AI, ensuring diversity in AI development teams, and devising robust regulations for oversight.</p>
