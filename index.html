                <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>In the technology sector, recent market movements highlight a divide among AI stocks.
Google (Alphabet Inc.) has experienced an upswing, potentially due to its strategic investments in deep learning technologies and diverse revenue streams, including data centers and cloud services, which are key enablers for AI applications.
Conversely, Oracle Corporation and Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) have faced downward pressure.
This trend may be attributed to their weaker ties with core AI-driven businesses—Oracle with its enterprise software and databases, and Meta with its social media platform that lacks significant AI integration.
Google's success could be linked to its extensive use of AI across its services, from search algorithms to self-driving cars through Waymo.
The market's 'show me' moment emphasizes the importance of clear demonstration of AI capabilities and tangible business growth for these companies.</p>
