<p>Researchers have discovered a vulnerability in ServiceNow's AI agents, demonstrating that these agents can be manipulated through "second-order prompts." This means an attacker could instruct one agent to perform an action, and subsequently trick another AI agent into acting contrary to its initial instructions.
The study by researchers at the University of Michigan reveals that this deception occurs due to the agents' context-dependent nature and the way they interpret complex prompts.
This poses significant security implications for organizations relying on these AI agents for tasks like customer service, IT operations, or automation, as it undermines their ability to function cohesively and consistently.</p>
